### Motivation

The template provided by the PNAS Article template in the
[rticles](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles) package makes it very easy
and convenient to create attractive looking two-column papers with an option
to switch to a one-column paper.

There were however a few changes we wanted to make such as the use of standard natbib citations,
more extended use of color, a different font as well as the removal of a number of PNAS-specific
title page items as well as general code and use simplification via a single LaTeX class file.  So
this _pinp_ package started.

### Example

#### Pinp Vignette

As of release 0.0.2, the package now has a vignette:

![](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/pinp/pinp-vignette.png)

#### Rcpp Vignette

A complete pdf example of the two-column default template is
provided [here](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/pinp/Rcpp-introduction.pdf)
by the new introductory [Rcpp](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) vignette, which is
itself based on our [PeerJ Prepint](https://peerj.com/preprints/3188/).

and the next two pages, showing a two-column figure

followed by pages five and six

and the final two pages:

Other Rcpp vignettes have been converted as well.

### Status

The package is working as expected, and available via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Usage 

Use the standard 

```r
install.packages("pinp")
```

to install it from CRAN, and then use as a Markdown template via RStudio, or use code such as

```r
library(rmarkdown)
draft("mypaper.Rmd", template="pdf", package="pinp", edit=FALSE)
render("mypaper.Rmd")
```

to create a first draft of a new `mypaper.Rmd`.

### Requirements

Beyond the R package dependencies, a working `pandoc` binary is needed. RStudio installs
its own copy, otherwise do what is needed on your OS (_i.e._, something like `sudo apt-get
install pandoc pandoc-citeproc`).

The pdf mode requires a fairly complete LaTeX installation, and has been used on Ubuntu and macOS.
On Debian/Ubuntu, the following packages should provide a working set:

```
texlive-base
texlive-binaries
texlive-fonts-extra
texlive-fonts-recommended
texlive-generic-recommended
texlive-humanities
texlive-latex-base
texlive-latex-extra
texlive-latex-recommended
texlive-pictures
texlive-publishers
texlive-science
```

Dirk Eddelbuettel and James Balamuta, leaning on the earlier work by JJ et al in the 
[rticles](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles) package.
